        The goal of the game is to get Object Boi to the goal. The goal is indicated by
        a green flag. Object Boi has the ability to clone himself so if he finds himself in a pinch,
        he will utilize that power to its fullest extent. Some clones may be used to trigger pressure
        plates which will open a the corresponding door when pressed. The object boi will need to
        remain standing on the plate in order for the door to remain open. Oh and there are also spikes
        that may get in your way so be careful.
