        The goal of the game is to drag Object Boi to the goal. The goal is indicated by
        a green flag. Sometimes Object boi will bring his goons along to solve a puzzle,
        Everyone may be used to trigger pressure plates, which will open a door when pressed.
        The door will only stay open while the pressure plate is pressed.
